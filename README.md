We select an architectural style for the top-level system architecture. Views are created to document the architecture at several levels of abstraction.

<ul>

 <li>Select an architectural style discussed in the lecture and apply it to your system.</li>

 <li>What makes this style particularly appropriate for your purpose? List and discuss relevant constraints and forces that motivated your decision for this style. How does it support the 2 system qualities that you selected in Assignment 6?</li>

 <li>Create a package or component diagram to visualize the top-level architectural style of the system.</li>

 <li>Take one component and further refine it by defining additional system structures and relationships at a second level of detail. Which architectural style do you choose for this component? The same as for the overall system architecture or a different one? Give reasons for this choice.</li>

 <li>Is there another architectural style for your system that would constitute a viable alternative? What makes this style one the one hand a good alternative, but on the other hand inferior to the one you prefer?</li>

</ul>
